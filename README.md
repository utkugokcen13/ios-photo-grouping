# PhotoGrouping

PhotoGrouping is an iOS app that scans the deviceâ€™s photo library, generates deterministic values for each photo, and groups them based on predefined ranges. It progressively updates results, persists state across app restarts, and offers a smooth browsing experience with UIKit + SwiftUI integration.  

## ðŸš€ Features

- ðŸ“¸ **Photo Scanning**  
  - Uses `PHAsset` to fetch all photos from the userâ€™s library.  
  - Generates a deterministic value for each photo (between 0 and 1).  
  - Assigns the photo into one of 20 predefined groups, or into **Others**.  

- âš¡ **Live Updates**  
  - Group counts and detail views update progressively during the scan.  
  - Horizontal progress bar with percentage label.  

- ðŸ’¾ **Persistence**  
  - Scan progress and group states are saved using JSON.  
  - App resumes **exactly where it left off** if killed.  
  - Groups remain consistent and photo counts are preserved across launches.  

- ðŸ–¼ **Screens**  
  - **Home Screen (UIKit)**: Displays groups in a `UICollectionView`.  
  - **Group Detail (SwiftUI)**: Lazy grid of thumbnails with smooth scrolling.  
  - **Image Detail (SwiftUI)**: Full-size image with swipe navigation between photos.  

- ðŸŽ¨ **Design**  
  - Hybrid UIKit + SwiftUI, no Storyboards.  
  - Blur effects, floating action button, and smooth navigation animations.  

## ðŸ›  Technical Highlights

- Language: **Swift 5+**  
- Minimum iOS Target: **15.0**  
- Architecture: **MVVM** (with Combine & async/await)  
- **No Storyboards** â€” UI built programmatically  
- Memory-efficient thumbnail loading with **PHCachingImageManager**  
- Incremental draining keeps UI smooth, even with thousands of photos
